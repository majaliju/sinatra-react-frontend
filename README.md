## WHAT IS THIS?
- This is the frontend repo of the BEST SONG REVIEWS website.

## INTRODUCTION

- Since the beginning of recorded history, humans have expressed an interest in music. The spectrum of musical appreciation can range from anthropological significance all the way to mere background noise while doing dishes. Nonetheless, all lovers of music have a preference towards certain types. These are often call, at least in the Western World, our "favorite songs."
- This site is meant to offer a simple page where users can post their favorite song: complete with the year of the song's release, the song's artist, and the primary genre the song belongs to. Users can leave reviews (as many as they want) under any song, and users can also like or dislike (as much as they want) any review under any song. Through the likes and dislikes of these reviews, we can get a sense of how much people agree or disagree with how others feel about the song! 
- On the right-hand side, there's a running tally of each artist, genre, and song that appears on this list. There's also a light and dark mode.
